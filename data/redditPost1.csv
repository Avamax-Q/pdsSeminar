"post","SchmuW2","Wondering what CPU to buy at any price point? Confused because there are so many options? Worry not, here's a guide for you.  Few notes before we begin  * I will use typical pricing over the last month or so according to Pcpartpicker, there might be amazing deals or firesales that might be available after this post, especially for those near a Micro Center.  * This guide is for those with access to only major online retailers, such as Newegg, Amazon, B&amp;H, and Bestbuy.  * Regardless of individual pricing, always try to find combos that may save you money.  * motherboard pricing will not be taken into account as there are decent and affordable motherboards all the way down to 100 USD for all chips mentioned.  * Ram pricing between ddr4 and ddr5 will not be accounted for as the pricing of ddr5 has gone down significantly and ddr5 is necessary for maximum performance in modern games.  * while intel can support faster ddr5, DDR5 5600 cl28 or 6000 cl30 is generally the sweet spot in value at around 120 USD, so do with that what you will.  * I will mention cooling requirements but you really do not need to worry about cooling for cpus less power hungry than the 13900k and 13700k as the Thermalright peerless assassin will cool any CPU less power hungry adequately for under 40 USD.  * All prices are for brand-new parts in USD.  With that let's get started:  * **Under $100:** Here, your options are the Ryzen 3 4100 at \~$70, the i3 10100f/10105f at \~$75, and the Ryzen 5 4500 at \~$80. AVOID the 4100, it sucks due to a limited 6 MB cache. The i3 and Ryzen 5 4500 generally perform similarly in games. However, I recommend the 4500 due to its higher core count (6c 12t vs 4c 8t) and better upgrade path. That being said, I wouldn't recommend any of these chips as there are much better options for only $20-30 more, so only consider these cpus if under a heavily constrained budget, like under $500.  * **$100-150:** Your options at this price range include:  1. Ryzen 5 5500 ($100) 2. Ryzen 5 4600g($100) 3. i3 12100f ($105) 4. i3 13100f ($120) 5. i3 12100 (\~$120-130) 6. Ryzen 5 5600g (\~$120-140) 7. Ryzen 5 5600 (\~$130-150) 8. i3 13100 ($150)  In this price range, there are strong arguments for both AMD and Intel. On team red, the options worth considering are the Ryzen 5 5500 and Ryzen 5 5600 as any g series CPU should only be considered for people wanting an APU(graphics+cpu in one chip) build due to a tight budget or wanting a PC for home theatre or a small form factor office PC. On the intel side, the only chip worth considering is the 12100f as the 13th gen variants are the same chip with slightly higher clocks and the non-f variant should only be considered when it is the same price or if you have a use case for quicksync encoding (via the intel igpu). For around $100 dollars, both the 5500 and 12100f have solid upgrade paths, similar gaming performance, and include an adequate stock cooler. The 5500 has a higher core count while the 12100f has support for pcie gen4 for the GPU and primary NVME slot, so pick your poison. I generally recommend the 5500 with the exception of those opting for a new budget GPU limited to pcie x4 like the RX 6500XT and RX 6400 (though please don't buy those, they suck and can't even hit 60 fps at 1080p low settings in new games without FSR). Either way, both are solid choices. For \~$140 at the time of writing, the 5600 is the best CPU for most buyers under $150 as it has double the cache of the 5500 with support for pcie gen 4 for the GPU and Primary nvme as well as more cores and better performance than the 13100 in most games.   * **$150-250:** for mid-range buyers, the options are:  1. i5 12400/f (\~$160-180) 2. Ryzen 5 5600x (\~$170) 3. Ryzen 7 5700x (\~$180-190) 4. i5 13400f ($210) 5. i5 12600k/kf (\~$200-250) 6. Ryzen 5 7600 ($230) 7. Ryzen 5 7600x (\~$240-250) 8. i5 13500 (\~$235-250)  In my opinion, there are 4 cpus worth considering: the i5 12400, i5 13500, Ryzen 5 7600, and 7600x. For under $200, the 12400f is the best choice as it performs slightly better than the 5600x while being cheaper and coming with a newer platform with a better upgrade path\* (\*note: Make sure you buy a decent mobo that can handle the upgrades, those chips are power hungry). The 5600x is simply a binned and higher clocked 5600 that only performs \~2-3% better for more money. Save it and get the 5600. The 5700x is only worth considering if you already have an AM4 motherboard as it is very power efficient with a 65W TDP, but comes in too close in pricing to the significantly better 13400f, so if spending around $200, get the i5. However, the best-value chips are the 7600/x and the 13500. The Ryzen 5 is generally a better choice if you are just gaming as it has higher IPC than the 13500, but the 13500 is a productivity beast for the price with 14 total cores (6P+8E) and 20 threads along with quicksync encoding. The 13500 also supports DDR4 while the 7600 does not, so if you want to get as much ram for as cheap as possible for ram-heavy workloads, the 13500 is a better option. TLDR: max fps get the Ryzen 7600/x, max productivity get the i5 13500.  * **$250-350:** for upper mid-range builders, your choices are:  1. i5 13600k/f ($300-320) 2. i7 12700k/f (\~$270-300) 3. Ryzen 7 5800X3D (\~$300-340) 4. Ryzen 7 7700 ($330) 5. Ryzen 7 7700x ($350)  The Ryzen 7 5800X3d is a good option for those already on AM4 but pointless for new builders when considering the Ryzen 7 7700 is just $15 more (as of writing) and includes a decent cooler. On the intel side, the 13600k has made the 12700k pointless to buy unless you can find it for a decently lower price as the 13600k performs better in nearly every task. The story of which CPU to buy is similar to that of the $250 price point, get the i5 if focused on productivity, get the Ryzen 7 if focused on gaming. The 7700x is only worth buying if you are going to use an aftermarket cooler and the price difference is under $20, as the 7700 runs cooler and way more efficiently at stock or matches the performance of the 7700x when enabling pbo. The 7700x is a better binned chip, so get that if wanting the max fps at the price and are willing to tune in order to get temps under control as for some odd reason AMD made it so all x variants of their 7000 series CPUs will try to hit 95c even when totally pointless. The 13600k performs a bit worse in games but excels in productivity due to the higher core count and inclusion of quicksync encoding.   * **$350-450:** for high-end buyers, the options are:  1. i7 13700/f ($360-400) 2. i7 13700k/kf ($390-420) 3. i9 12900k/kf (\~$400) 4. Ryzen 9 7900/x (\~$420-430) 5. Ryzen 7 7800X3D ($450\* you may have to wait to get it at MSRP due to high demand)  Starting with intel, the i7 13700k is worth it over the non-k as the latter loses a significant amount of performance due to lower clock speeds and binning (source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-JlT5a3UwE&amp;t=525s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-JlT5a3UwE&amp;t=525s)). The i7 13700k finally closes the gap in gaming performance with AMD, beating all ryzen 7000 non-X3D cpus in gaming and trading blows with the 7900x in productivity (source: [https://www.techspot.com/review/2657-amd-ryzen-7800x3d/](https://www.techspot.com/review/2657-amd-ryzen-7800x3d/), [https://www.techspot.com/review/2554-intel-core-i7-13700k/](https://www.techspot.com/review/2554-intel-core-i7-13700k/)). The ryzen 9 7900 is an interesting option for efficiency-focused productivity systems, but lags behind the 13700k and 7900x significantly in productivity due to the 65w TDP and needs PBO to bring the performance up to par. However, at that point might as well get the 7900x for cheaper (as of writing) as you will need to replace the stock cooler anyway if you want to run PBO at reasonable noise levels. As for the 7800X3D, it is not only the best overall gaming CPU but is the most efficient one as well. The only catch is relatively poor productivity performance due to the reduced core count and temperature limits, lagging behind even the much cheaper ryzen 7700x. Overall, for people focused on just gaming, the 7800X3D is the best CPU while the 13700k is a better all rounder for great performance in games and productivity apps. The only reason to go with the 7900/x is if you have a specific use case where the chip is ideal or want the better productivity performance on the am5 platform so that you can upgrade down the line.   * **$500+:** For the ultra high end users looking to build on a mainstream platform, the options are:  1. i9 13900/f (\~$550) 2. i9 13900k/f (\~$550-570) 3. Ryzen 9 7900X3D ($585-600) 4. Ryzen 9 7950x ($585-600) 5. Ryzen 9 7950X3D ($700) 6. i9 13900ks ($730)  For high-end buyers, ignore the i9 13900 non-k and Ryzen 7900X3D unless the price drops significantly, the i9 non-k is priced the same as the K part while being a worse chip and the 7900X3D delivers both underwhelming gaming performance when compared to the soon to be cheaper 7800X3D and underwhelming productivity performance compared to both its cheaper non-3D sibling and the competing i9 13900k (which is also cheaper). Also, ignore the 13900ks, it barely performs any better than the 13900k while costing over $150 more and managing to do an even better job at heating your entire house. The 7950x and X3D are worth considering for people conscious of cooling requirements and power draw as both chips, especially the X3D variant, consume way less power for similar multi-core performance, and superior gaming performance in the case of the 7950X3D. However, if cooling and heat output are not of concern, the 13900k is a solid option due to better overall productivity performance and superior gaming performance to the 7950x, and only loses to the X3D by about 5% for significantly cheaper. However, you will also be stuck with a dead-end platform, as the 13900k is basically the most powerful CPU the LGA 1700 socket will ever support. AM5, on the other hand, will be supported through 2025. TLDR: 13900K best short-term value, 7950X3D for the long-haul.   &amp;#x200B;  Overall, the CPU market has gotten extremely competitive in recent years and there is a good option for you no matter the price point. Intel is bringing some amazing productivity CPUs with high core counts for the price while AMD is bringing fantastic gaming performance with their Ryzen 7600 and 7700 at the mid to upper mid-range as well as their X3D cpus in the high-end, as well as amazing efficiency and a platform with long-term support.   Whenever buying a CPU, make sure to not overspend, as the GPU should be the priority for a gaming PC and should take up no less than a third of the total cost of the system, preferably up to a half. in other words, the GPU should cost at least double the cost of the CPU. Keep in mind that most data is taken at 1080p or 1440p with an rtx 4090, those using something like a 3080 or 6800xt will be GPU bound in almost every game at 1440p with any of these CPUs over $150.   My sources include multiple videos and reviews from channels like Hardware Unboxed, Linus Tech tips, Tech Notice, Gamers Nexus, and Hardware Canucks as well as media outlets like Tom's Hardware and TechPowerUp. Feel free to check out any of these sources if you have questions about any performance claims.   Hope this guide was helpful, and good PC building!",440,2023-04-09 22:22:13,"12gxw9n",NA

"comment","Keljian52","The thing this is missing, imnsho, is recommendations at each level  My recommendations are the following:  * If you're purely gaming and are not buying budget, get a 7800x3D and 32gig of 6000mhz ddr5 ram * if you're gaming and doing light to medium productivity (occasional coding, rendering, etc) get a 13600k, and a minimum of 32gb of ram * if you want to upgrade on the cheap, get a 13500 and a ddr4 board to use with your existing ddr4 (if you have 16-32 gig) - it will perform close to the 13600 and you should be able to get it relatively inexpensively * if you're going heavy on productivity software get either a 13900k or 7950x - they're both very good, I lean intel cause the platform is more tolerant of having more memory and if you're buying for productivity, you want a fair bit of memory * if you're on the AM4 platform, the 13600k is an easy upgrade using your existing ddr4 and it is pretty much as fast as the 5800x3d in games and is much faster in productivity software * Don't get a chip without inbuilt gpu, cause if your graphics card dies, you'll want something to keep you going, always go a K over a KF. Plus you can use it for encoding if you want. * If you're encoding all day every day, or rendering all day every day, get a 7950 or 7900 (non x)  In a nutshell - the 13500, 13600k, 13900k, 7900 and 7950x are the pick of the bunch in this generation for value vs performance in my book. The 13600k is really the stand out, value wise.   That said , if you can get a bundle with the 7900x (for less than the price of a 7700x) or the 13700k (for less than price of a 13600k) , they may become worthwhile",47,2023-04-10 05:32:31,"jfnwfh1","t3_12gxw9n"

There's 2 relevant specs to cpus, the speed of a single core, and the speed of the entire chip, the rest is marketing nonsense, we are still running x86 cpus, the same as 40 years ago, they just run a thousand times faster, basically we have glorified 386 cpus that have been overclocked to extreme insanities.

"comment","dark_LUEshi","If you really wanted to go into this argument you would have talked about ARM, x86 cpus have had coprocessors since their inception.  The x86 instruction set is what ties them together, you can still run programs from 40 years ago compiled for an 386 cpu on a modern one. This is like being able to play a NES game on a switch(not exactly, x86 cpus don't need to emulate the code) doubling the adresse length doesn't change much to how the cpu operates, it just adds a crapton more adresses so you can operate more system memory.  &amp;#x200B;  lmao doesn't really change how you think of it, the core of an x86 cpu is the ability to run x86 instructions set, and these have changed very little since they were first written down, Of course cpus didn't have gpu's back then, here I was just comparing what a 386 does with a modern cpu, and it's still basically the exact same thing, except a thousand times faster. The same ASM instructions.     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86\_instruction\_listings",-6,2023-04-10 10:22:49,"jfogtzn","t1_jfofrnw"

"comment","dark_LUEshi","Maybe i'm being a bit too defensive,     Computers have a base language, it's called assembly, ASM for short, these are the instructions that the cpu run and ASM code makes very little sense to us human, and is very hard to read and debug, well these ASM instructions exist in a wide variety of flavors, from IBM PowerPC architecture, to ARM used in android phones, to RISC and whatever cpus you can imagine. well when code gets ""compiled"" its usually the source code(C#, C++, etc) that gets translated into ASM so the cpu for a particular architecture can understand it, when you have the source code, you can compile for a variety of architectures, compilers can handle the different architectures and how to ""build"" the asm code out of the source code.      Those very same ASM instructions compiled in 1997 for the first release of doom, should still run on a modern intel cpu, because all the correct instructions are still present and operate in the same way (might need a few modifications to slow the game down cuz nobody would have thoughts we'd run cpus so fast back then), this means the code doesn't need to be emulated, it runs natively off the cpu, because it was made for such a cpu. kinda how some consoles had backwards compatibility, Now trying to get an n64 game to run on a switch is a whole other deal. N64 was an IBM architecture, The code could be entirely rewritten, but in this case it's probably simpler to just use an emulator since the switch has over 10x the power of a n64, emulators makes it simpler, at the cost of a bit more processing.     You couldnt say the same for a game made for NES, an x86 cpu wouldn't have any idea what to do with it, same for your android .apk's on your phone, those are programs compiled for a specific architecture. It's generally pretty transparent to the user and each architecture has it's own advantages, x86 belongs to intel, selling a license to AMD was a huge mistake they won't ever be able to take back. We don't really think about architectures much, but it's one of the main reason android phones (and the nintendo switch) can have such great battery life in such small form factors. This is the evolution of a microprocessor, what intel has done with x86 chips is great, but it's kinda holding everything back. Nobody will ever be allowed again in that playground. This is why these days people are starting to look again at alternate architectures and I wouldn't be surprised if one of the older one s comes back from the dead.",1,2023-04-10 11:03:43,"jfojzqo","t1_jfoi3hb"

"comment","dark_LUEshi","nobody even talked about efficiency, this is one of the most retarded argument in history in favor of AMD lol. Since when do fanboys give two shits about efficency of their cpu's ? fanboys are tripping out cuz it makes the intel 13900k look bad, but in reality they're not. ""Gaming cpu"" is the most idiotic thing that AMD has ever pulled off, prepare to eat your own socks. if intel has to add cache to their cpu, they won't ruin the performance like AMD did.      There was a time when AMD cpus were awesome, it was before intel walled everything off with their cool proprietary tech, from rapid storage to thunderbolt 4 to whatever the fuck you like. Not only is the 13900k still the fastest cpu on the planet, it runs on the best platform. But yeah if you don't like nice things, you can always buy AMD. I care very little about some extra cache that helps run dogshit badly optimized games. No reason at all top end cpus should be maxing out in any games.",-6,2023-04-10 12:35:01,"jfoson8","t1_jfoqzzy"

"comment","Gippy_","Ehh, most people thought Z790 didn't bring enough additional features to the table over Z690. Some manufacturers actually made their Z790 motherboards _worse_ in order keep the same price point despite inflation. Check out [**this**](https://www.gigabyte.com/Comparison/Consumer/Result/2?pids=8558,8127) comparison between Gigabyte's Aorus Elite AX DDR4 boards, Z690 vs Z790:   * The Z690 board has a better audio codec. (ALC1220-VB vs. ALC897) * The Z690 board has more SATA ports. (6 vs. 4) * The Z690 board has DisplayPort out. (not a big deal) * The Z690 board has better VRMs. (direct 16+1+2 70A vs. hybrid 16+1+2 60A) * The Z790 board has a slightly newer wi-fi module that supports the 6GHz band. (don't care, I use LAN) * This particular Z790 board can't take advantage of its one feature it has over Z690, which is running 5 NVMe PCI-e 4.0 SSDs at full speed, as it only has 4 M.2 slots. (Z690 runs 3 at full speed, which is good enough.)  Virtually all of the higher-end boards from Asus or MSI I can immediately dismiss because they have Intel 2.5GB LAN instead of Realtek 2.5GB LAN. Intel 2.5GB LAN (I-225V or I-226V) [**is absolute dogshit**](https://www.techpowerup.com/303854/psa-intel-i226-v-2-5gbe-on-raptor-lake-motherboards-has-a-connection-drop-issue-no-fix-available) and Intel still hasn't fully fixed its issues.

"comment","mdchemey","Really good overall post, though platform price vs performance tends to be a bit different and that complicates things a bit, for example a 13600k with DDR4 can compete in platform price with a 7600/X thanks to the latter being locked into DDR5 but it also sacrifices a decent bit of performance in many (not all) games and tasks so it becomes a (gaming) performance competitor with the Ryzen 5s as well while still competing in productivity with a Ryzen 7.

"comment","mdchemey","It works, though PBO isn't supported on the A620s by default (apparently one model of ASUS A620 does support it but I haven't seen any prices on it to know whether it would be worth getting) and you give up what I consider to be significant enough features to make it worthwhile. As to the two models that are already available, the $89 model is designed to only run with 65W CPUs and while it shouldn't bottleneck the extremely efficient 7800X3D too badly there are definitely times where it would want to draw more than that board can give so it's really only worth comparing the $103 board to the $120 (typically, though currently it's $140 unless you live close to a microcenter) B650M-HDV/M.2 where the extra $17 gets you the following:  *  PBO as mentioned before * a faster ethernet port (2.5 gig vs 1 gig; gigabit probably won't bottleneck you but faster is a nice to have) * better expansion (secondary PCIe slots are 4.0 x1 and 4.0 x4 pinouts instead of 2x 3.0 x1) * 2 more rear USB 2 ports * an extra USB 3 internal header (supporting dual 5 gigabit USB-A ports) * a USB-C 10 gigabit internal header (most decent cases these days have front panel USB-C so to populate it you'd need an adapter or add in card on the A620) * a faster primary M.2 slot (for when PCIe 5 drives actually start to make a real difference) * a built in heatsink for the primary M.2 slot (since PCIe 4 and 5 drives can often run quite hot) * a built in IO shield and better VRM/IO heatsink/shroud (mostly an aesthetic benefit but definitely better in that regard)  Like, even PBO being accessible makes the B650 model probably worth the difference. If you're buying a 7800X3D with a build that will actually benefit from its extra gaming power over something like a 7700, odds are you're spending $800+ (4070ti/7900XT or better) on GPU. At a pricepoint of $1250+ for CPU/GPU alone, a difference of $17 to enable the ability to tune/boost your CPU's performance *and* to get significantly better all-around IO (front, rear, and expansion) is just a no brainer. In the end very few people will *really* need or use anything you can't get from the B650M-HDV but plenty will need features that just aren't on the A620s.",1,2023-04-11 00:36:16,"jfrnxvt","t1_jfrfrgg"

In terms of it being a scam, it was called a scam because it performs worse than the 7800x3d in many games while being more expensive and purposely launched first in order to force people to pay the early premium.

"comment","Keljian52","I've argued against the power consumption - that's under load. The vast majority of the time a processor is idling while a person is working.  That said, while scheduling will improve over time, Microsoft and AMD have had 4 generations of Ryzen to improve their scheduling and multi CCX cpus still have scheduling issues. I am not hopeful this will be resolved in a reasonable timeline as the 7900x3d and 7950x3d are extremely niche chips, essentially for enthusiasts who game and are into 3d rendering/heavy encoding and who work from home. (Think of the customer and proportion of sales vs the 7800x3d for gamers).  While the intel platform is a ""dead end"" after raptor lake refresh, AMD have committed to 2-3 years support on the AM5 platform. If you have a high end processor now, your upgrade cycle (unless you're an absolute enthusiast) will be more like 4-5 years, so you get the value out of it.  Going with either platform therefore will mean you will want a new motherboard for your next upgrade",1,2023-04-11 01:53:45,"jfryb8l","t1_jfpboc8"
"comment","Gippy_","&gt; Ram pricing between ddr4 and ddr5 will not be accounted for  Many people still have DDR4 memory. If you have expensive sticks, or a large amount of it (64GB+) then a buyer may want to go Intel over AMD and reuse the memory. 64GB of 6000MHz CL30 DDR5 costs $290, and in a few years, that will probably be too slow. My first DDR4 build had 2400MHz sticks which were replaced by 3600MHz sticks later.  &gt; For high-end buyers, ignore the i9 13900 non-k ... is priced the same as the K part while being a worse chip  It's typically about $20 cheaper. What you're missing is that the vanilla part has a PL2 of 219W. The K part has a PL2 of 253W on paper, but most Z mobos set this to unlimited (typically ~300-340W before thermal throttling) in order to top the benchmark charts. You could lower the PL2 on the K part, but then it'll be clocked lower just like the 13900 anyway. I could see a case of someone getting a 13900+B660 mobo over 13900K+Z690 in order to save about $100.  &gt; Also, ignore the 13900ks, it barely performs any better than the 13900k while costing over $150 more and managing to do an even better job at heating your entire house.  The 13900KS is binned and can typically operate at lower voltage for a given clock speed. If limiting PL2, that will actually matter. However, the other reason to avoid the 13900KS is because of the Raptor Lake-S refresh announcement. The used market for the highest-end CPUs of any given socket usually command a price premium well after the socket has been retired. (Check eBay for the QX9775, or more recently, the 10980XE.) The 13900KS might end up being a terrible buy if Intel releases something like a 13950KS later this year. However, if the 13900KS remains the flagship model, then it'll have much better resale value in the future than the 13900K.",2,2023-04-10 03:18:27,"jfnjulf","t3_12gxw9n"
"comment","SchmuW2","There is nothing preventing anyone from pairing a 13900k with a b660/B760 motherboard, they are still perfectly compatible.

"comment","Gippy_","If you set both chips' PL2 to 219W (the 13900 has this by default) then the 13900K will clock down and won't hit 5.8GHz anyway. Technically running anything out of Intel spec is overclocking, so all of the Z boards that run the 13900K at 300-340W instead of 253W are doing this.  The 13700K is actually less efficient than the 13900K. The 13900K @160W has a higher Cinebench R20 score than the 13700K @253W because of the doubled E-Core count.

"comment","sumrix","The same for 7950X and 13900K. For productivity workloads, the 7950X delivers the same or better performance while consuming considerably less power. According to benchmarks from the same link, in six out of ten non-gaming benchmarks, the 7950X outperforms the 13900K, and in two of them, the performance is similar.",1,2023-04-29 11:15:55,"ji666kk","t1_ji14ota"
