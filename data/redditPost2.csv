"post","Barnaboule69","Most of the time when I see the 7800X3D get recommended the two main arguments is that it's cheaper than intel with better price/performance and that current intel processors suck because of bad QC or whatnot, but right now the price/performance point is moot considering that the 7800X3D is 350$ more expensive than the 14700k and the newer 9800X3D is back ordered everywhere for months while also being way more expensive.  What is the warranty like with those current gen intel chipsets? Did anyone have issue returning one that failed? Is there actually any reliable stats as to the failure rate of those CPU's? Like is it 1% of CPU's that end up being defective or is it more like over 25%?",127,2024-11-24 19:16:47,"1gyyxtp",NA
"comment","Withinmyrange","x3d prices have inflated but I still wouldnt even go intel in the near future. Ideally we want both amd and intel to be good so we consumers benefit from competion.  AM5 is a much better platform than LGA 1700 and 1851. 13 and 14th gen cpus have the risk of exploding and lga 1700 is dead after that. LGA 1851 with the arrow lake processors have flopped. They lose to previous gen intel and amd and not even neccessarily better at power efficiency. AM5 will last at least one more generation and you can rely on the cpu's.  Imo, just get a 7700X and call it a day. You will enjoy your gaming rig at the end of the day. When you find a good deal on a 9000x3d chip or when AM6 is out and AMD drops a price performance monster for the AM5 like AM4's 5700x3d, thats when you upgrade. You get so much more value out of your build if you properly utilize the upgradeability.",140,2024-11-24 19:46:41,"lysfexe","t3_1gyyxtp"

A significant number of Intel 13th and 14th CPUs have experienced oxidation, and considering Intel is no longer able to replace these chips in RMA thanks to discontinued supply we can no longer trust that the chips we are purchasing are not oxidized in any way.   3) testing has confirmed all issues with the 7000x3D chips were with motherboard BIOS and there were zero chips with any oxidation issues or issues inherent to the chips. 3rd party testers confirmed the issue no longer exists. It was a guarantee, unlike the oxidation issues.  3) why buy a generation old chip + mobo on a platform that cannot host future gen chips? Thats just a waste of money.

And your statement about AMD-V is a matter of opinion. Again, it depends entirely on the use case as to which gives the most benefits. There's no alternative to VT-d that I'm aware of in AMD, and if single thread performance is what matters then Intel takes the win. For my personal home rig, this is what I need.

"comment","mentive","14700k was failing a lot less than 14900k. If you upgrade the bios, you should be relatively safe with a new one. Considering the price difference, and especially if you will use your computer for heavier tasks outside of gaming, the i7 could serve you well and better for some other tasks that you may or may not do.  On the other hand, there will probably be another generation processor after the 9800x3d on the same socket that could possibly be upgraded later. An AMD x3d is going to be better in gaming regardless for almost every title. Puts off a lot less heat than Intel (adds a LOT to room temp)  Overall, AMD is most likely going to be the best choice for you.  I have a 14700k and love it.

So if you are a gamer only I'd go with the AMD , if you do productivity , dual purpose machine I'd definitely  go with raptor lake  at its new price point as the platform should last 2/3 more years . I was thinking about the 9900/9950x3d coming in march but they will be 700/800 bucks plus M/B , I'll upgrade my GPU as I'm never CPU bound only gpu bound as I don't game at 1080p as is everyone who Games over 1080p making the 9800x3d w waste",1,2025-01-26 17:01:56,"m9ajpad","t3_1gyyxtp"
"comment","heikkiiii","You'll also need an AIO and beefier power supply to run 14700k. Plus with amd you dont have to worry about your cpu dying on you, i would pay premium for that any day.",1,2024-11-24 19:28:47,"lysbwra","t3_1gyyxtp"
"comment","allen_antetokounmpo","You absolutely no need beefy aio for 14700k, i run 14700k with thermalright PS120 se and it can handle it just fine, and good psu not really that expensive nowdays, and you dont want cheap psu even if you running 7800x3d",33,2024-11-24 19:47:38,"lysflti","t1_lysbwra"
"comment","noithatweedisloud","i actually can’t believe how good thermalright coolers are for the price. i also have that cooler and it’s a monster, i’ll probably never get an AIO unless cpus get way hotter",5,2024-11-24 21:40:17,"lyt1sdk","t1_lysflti"
"comment","Affectionate-Memory4","You don't need an aio for a 14700k. My 14900K has been under a PA120se and that handles the full 253W just fine. The 14700K draws the same or less.",7,2024-11-24 20:55:12,"lysswij","t1_lysbwra"
"comment","heikkiiii","its rated for 200w. You can do some gaming with it, but if you do some heavy cpu games you're going to near the thermal limits, especially if you overclock it.",-11,2024-11-24 21:23:22,"lysyj65","t1_lysswij"
"comment","Affectionate-Memory4","Yes, but still, you do not need an AIO for a 14700k. And, at least in my setup, the cooler is handling well more than 200W. My 14900K regularly hits 253W on this cooler, and after the PL2 Tau limit, backs down to the 170W PL1 I set. You can absolutely have stock, or in this case still a little more than stock performance on an air cooler.",6,2024-11-24 21:59:50,"lyt5gf4","t1_lysyj65"
"comment","laffer1","For gaming, probably not. It’s mostly bursty. An aio keeps it boosting longer but it’s a light workload for most games.  For other workloads where it’s going to be pegged, get a better cooler.",1,2024-11-25 02:24:46,"lyue2hm","t1_lyt5gf4"
"comment","Affectionate-Memory4","I will add that this is my workstation system. It spends a good bit of time under load thanks to Fusion and Inventor. It is well acquainted with that 170W PL1 and the 253W PL2.  If it was liquid cooled, sure, it could stay at 300W+ forever. But to be honest, the performance difference between when it is under PL2 vs PL1 is already slim enough that I don't believe it's worth the extra you need to push this thing to the absolute max 100% of the time. My workload is sustained single-core mixed with few-minute bursts of multi-core most of the time, and I feel that represents most workstations quite well.",1,2024-11-25 02:37:11,"lyug03a","t1_lyue2hm"

"comment","[deleted]","Realistically no one needs a 7800X3D for gaming... In general, the sweet point for gaming is at the Ryzen 5, while the 7 is better for applications that require a lot of multicore, multithread, and the threadripper is for workstations and simulation where you need a fuckton of cache, fuckton of RAM, and a bunch of multitasking.  Nothing from Intel right now beats the AM5 R5 for gaming, it's too early to futureproof as prices will come down eventually for AM5 and DDR5... you're better off with a 5000 series AM4 chip for the next 3-4 years... then when price comes down you go for an AM5 with a fuckton of DDR5 memory",0,2024-11-24 21:32:54,"lyt0dbf","t3_1gyyxtp"

"comment","althaz","I mean don't buy a 14700k or 14900k for basically any reason - they are seemingly all some level of faulty. Intel has been incredibly suspect with how they've handled the situation with the 14- and 13-series chips and IMO you just should not buy one, basically ever (although I believe the 14600k or below is in the clear).  If you can get a 12700k for cheap enough it is still a totally fine CPU though.  It has to be significantly cheaper than a 7700 or 9700X though - probably at least 25% cheaper to be worth it considering all of the (many) disadvantages. Both are a bit faster, on a vastly better platform and use half the power.",-3,2024-11-24 22:25:57,"lyta7c4","t3_1gyyxtp"

EDIT: mind anyone, im telling to stay away from intel but im running a 13900K, for context.",-5,2024-11-24 21:48:06,"lyt39ty","t3_1gyyxtp"
