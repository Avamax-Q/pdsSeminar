"post","theHawasian15","Hey Y'all,   I've been in the fence of getting back into PC Gaming for quite a while now. Just about ready to pull the trigger, but I have some CPU questions...   It sounds like Intel may have dropped the ball with Arrow Lake when it comes to gaming. I had been holding out to get the latest chip set, but the more I think about it, is it really worth getting a less performant CPU now when I could get an Intel Core i9-13900K now and upgrade the processor and MoBo in the event Intel drops a Z890 compatible CPU worth getting.   That said, I'm also open to AMD, I'm just not as familiar with them. It sounds like they'll be dropping the X3D chips in a few weeks. The can of worms there though is that Microcenter has what looks like a pretty sweet AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D, MSI X670E MAG Tomahawk WiFi, G.Skill Flare X5 Series 32GB DDR5 6000 for $730. I'm also wondering about the chip set there? Would I be again be buying something on the cusp of obsolescence?",96,2024-10-24 14:58:07,"1gb4mk9",NA

"comment","talalit","lol I'm tired of people talking about upgrade path as a reason to pick what platform to build.

"comment","Nobli85","AM4 has had 8 years of support and products released to date. Upgrade path IS relevant here because you can stay on the same socket and quadruple your performance (for example; Ryzen 1600 to Ryzen 5800X3D).   I stayed on my  one and only AM4 motherboard through 3 different CPU upgrades every couple of years. I didn't even go with the highest end parts, was just a nice gen on gen improvement and I was able to sell my prior CPU each time. Cost very little and I always had close to the best gaming performance at the time. There's a lot of value in that.",20,2024-10-24 23:27:09,"ltljbkk","t1_ltjjufy"

"comment","anzurakizz","Even though you are correct that is a rare exception that probably wont happen again. Ryzen was way underpower on launch, the only advantage they had was cheaper than intel and more cores, but the single core performance was way behind intel. Only when Zen 3 came out (Ryzen 5000), they beat Intel in performance, but they lost the price advantage they had.   Look at Zen 5 (Ryzen 9000). There is zero improvement over Zen 4. Intel had a bigger improvement from Haswell to Skylake than this. I think AMD will stagnate and there won't be that big of an upgrade path like AM4.",1,2024-10-25 12:15:40,"lto6tmm","t1_ltljbkk"
"comment","Nobli85","I don't have to look at Zen 5 because I bought one already. I'll do the exact same thing I did with AM4 on my AM5 board. I went from 7800X3D to 9700X for free because of the stupid high resale of the X3D, and my multicore performance went up 20% in most of the productive applications I use (primarily not gaming). 18.5K CBR23 score to 25K. The improvement isn't shown until you unlock PBO on 7000 and then compare it to unlocked 9000.   Not to mention most info on Zen 5 is still launch day reviews that show virtually zero performance improvement. My 9700X is performing far better than my 7800X3D did, and in single core it outperforms my brother's 7950X by a good margin.  Edit: For clarification, yes I'm aware that X3D has lower clock speed and to compare a part with regular cache and X3D isn't quite fair, but the performance I gained still matters, and windows feels much smoother and snappier on the new CPU for whatever reason.",1,2024-10-25 12:21:16,"lto7mmu","t1_lto6tmm"

The os itself runs fine on that machine but Windows 10 is missing the bit of code to shut down the psu after shutting down the os, so you have to cold shut off the pc after every shut down to get the fans to stop turning.    Then Windows 10 has issues with gigabyte b450 drivers and somehow messes up the Radeon drivers every time it updates.    Windows 10 has no conflicts with the msi a320 when updating though and Radeon drivers update with a breeze.    Of course the b450 is not Windows 11 compliant though.",1,2024-10-25 11:25:55,"lto07dt","t1_ltn1y23"
"comment","thatissomeBS","Yeah, upgrade path only makes sense if you're the type of person to buy the best newest chip every generation. But also, if you don't mind spending the money for those chips, I can't imagine the motherboard or RAM are what bankrupts you.   Now, it's super nice to have the 5700x3d as a potential upgrade to my 5600, and likely will happen relatively soon, but also I'm not in desperate need and would happily keep what I have for a few more years if there wasn't a surprisingly cheap and very good upgrade available.",-2,2024-10-24 17:39:43,"ltjp2a4","t1_ltjjufy"

"comment","[deleted]","Let's simplify big time There are 2 CPUs I currently recommend for gaming:     1) the 7600/x (because it is good enough for most people, and it is cheap). This is a good choice if you're happy with 60 FPS (or a little more, but probably not 120) in AAA games and higher in competitive games.    2) the 7800X3D, because it is currently the best gaming CPU on the market. This is a good choice if you are willing to spend more for higher FPS, if you play very cpu-intensive games, or you care a lot about 1% lows.  Or if you are buying a very high-end GPU like a 4080s/4090.     All the other AMD 7000 CPUs fall inbetween those, and they are fine. All 7000 series CPUs will have a good upgrade path. If you can get, say, a 7700x in a Microcenter bundle for cheaper than a 7600, go for it. Probably once the 9800X3D releases in a couple weeks, it will join this list.",6,2024-10-24 16:34:33,"ltjbt31","t3_1gb4mk9"

"comment","thatissomeBS","I know this is unpopular opinion around here, but I think even if you're starting from scratch on a mid-range build, the 5700x3D isn't a bad platform to build. A 5700x3D with a decent board and 32gb of decent RAM can be had for $300, which is about $100 less than a similar setup with the 7600. There are a lot of things that make the 7600 setup worth that extra $100, but also spending that extra $100 on the GPU can get you a 7800xt instead of 7700xt.
